This has to be by far the best game I have ever had the honor to play! There are so many options that you can easly make your fighting tatics and battle plans one of a kind. A tip to new players that may read this message, the game might be a bit confusing at start but after a week you'll know the game by heart if you choose too.

This is to direct the general attention of newer players, and older ones who may not know about it, to the website/forums/wiki provided generously by our host at slayn.net

It is located at http://aoc.slayn.net
 
Thank Grave for setting it up :) What a guy.
 
For those who may be interested in an IRC thing for Assault, direct your attention to the 'Serious Discussions' board on the forums. As explained in the post, it's likely much too early for such a channel, and I'm just gauging the response from the general playerbase. I'm not planning on researching it until much later, so if you think it's a good idea, don't get your hopes up. If you think it's a bad idea, get your hopes up a lot.
 
Otherwise, just feel free to explore and chat on the forums, or maybe help out on the wiki.. It needs articles people! I'm working on command currently but I'm sure I could use some help, and so could Vehicles/Buildings/Weapons/Whatever else there is to explain.
 
Tentatively,

Effective immediately, anyone who suicides/purposely gets killed in order to evade death @@eWILL@@N be loaded up and made available for all to attack. This MUD is about killing and getting killed, what is the purpose of playing a MUD where you do the direct opposite of what you're supposed to? If you don't want to get killed, then don't play a kill-or-be-killed MUD. @@eSIMPLE AS THAT.@@N
 
Also, though it is not illegal, killing your base to prevent others from ranking is severely frowned upon. Anything that involves you using cheap tactics in such a way that hinders others from making legitimate ranks and/or kills will only make others want to kill you more. Please, just play the MUD, don't be a pansy and try to keep everyone down. Just today, CB and PG had a full-fledged war, resulting in a base being utterly demolished. There are no hard feelings, no regrets, and especially no bitches; the battle was carried out to the very last building, which is what the administration likes to see. Make from the example and just play the MUD as it should be, please don't make me have to shut down this place because people don't want to play the MUD as it is.

Very Important Info - Please Read! @@aSun Dec 23 16:10:11 2007
@@N~
This was originally written by Xyre, but I'll repost it.
Alright, here's a REALLY important thing for people to know about attacking - it's called command stacking.
 
The trick is to be a suicide bomber, and then set your bombs to have something like a 60 second timer. During the time you're arming the bomb, have an alias/a number of directions copy pasted where you want to drop the bombs.
 
Say that the other persons base was ten east of you. So, to put it along their wall, you'd do something like e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
drop bomb
s
drop bomb
s
drop bomb
 (10 east, drop bomb, south, drop bomb, south, drop bomb.) This allows you to drop three bombs all along their wall.
 
The important thing to remember is to enter in ALL of that at once while you're arming one bomb. In order to do longer commands, try arming one bomb, immediately arming another, and then hitting your alias.

If the game gets a player base one of the older player will just get on and rape everyone...
Game needs rank brackets or it's not going to ever work again.

idea @@aMon Nov 24 09:41:34 2008

I think the idea would be to make a 5 rank limit. So if I was rank 1 and some rank 20 wants to kill me, it wouldn't be possible.

Another idea. If possible, then you could make a system, that for example says that you are 10 rooms away from a possible quest location or something like this. Or that the quest location is x steps west and y steps north for example.

The one problem I can see regarding ranks limiting attacks is that if we get a lack of players say from rank 75 - 100, how will a 76 advance, or 65, etc....

This is just notification that some object listing was broken, and I had to restore it. It seems to work fine, just don't knwo what problems it may cause.
 
I don't have time to sort it all out, and not entirely sure, since a blank file seemed to have done nothing for the game but sped it up. I will sort it out later.
